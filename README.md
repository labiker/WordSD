Welcome to WordSD!

WordSD is a 2D game engine based entirely on Pixijs.

It provides the necessary features needed to develop text adventure games.

Different from traditional game engines, it pursues a new way of game development.

WordSeed is currently in its infancy, and anyone interested in developing a game engine is welcome to join!
